	<p>Table containing road network<p>

		<p>-	sec = section label<p>
		<p>-	geom = linestring geometry.<p>
		<p>-	buff = buffer around geom for use in autofitting. st_buffer(st_linemerge(geom),30,'endcap=flat join=round'); works well
		<p>-	meas_len = 'official' length of section. Used to calculate section chainage.<p>
		<p>-	one_way = True where section is one way. used for autofitting.<p>
		<p>-	road = road name<p>
		<p>-	rbt = True where section is roundabout. st_buffer often wrong shape for roundabouts. Something like:	"update network set buff=st_buffer(st_makePolygon(geom),30) where rbt" fixes this.<p>
		<p>-	benchmark = True where section is benchmark.<p>
