        <h3 id="fitting">Fitting</h3>

		<p>The <a href="routes.html">routes table </a> defines which section/direction/xsp readings ( <a href="r.html">table r</a> ) are in. The fitting tab contains tools for editing it. <p>

		<p>Readings in run with s<=f_line<=e are fit to sec,reversed,xsp<p>

		<p>start_sec_ch and end_sec_ch only need to be set where the gps is inaccurate. They are the section chainages (in direction of section) where the route enters/leaves the section.Where they are valid (>=0)they are used to calculate section chainages of readings.<p>
		<p>  Otherwise the closest point of the section to the reading is used.<p>
		<p>The notes column is for the benefit of the person fitting. Autofit will insert rows with a note of 'auto'. <p>
		


	<h4 id="fitting">How to use</h4>
		<P>Click the autofit button to automatically create the route for the selected run. It is likely to make mistakes where:<P>

		<P> -The nearest section to a reading is not the correct one <P>
		<P> -The gps is inaccurate <P>
		<P> -The network is inaccurate <P>


		<P>Autofit does not work out xsp. Do this by manually or with update statement (update routes set xsp='CL1' where not reversed; update routes set xsp='CR1' where reversed;).<P>


		<p> Set start_sec_ch and end_sec_ch column where the gps is inaccurate. This will be important for tunnels and small roundabouts (that readings are closer to wrong side of).  <p>

		<p> Rows with a yellow background have have a gap and should be checked. <p>
		<p> Rows with a red background overlap by more than 1 reading and are probabaly wrong.<p>

		<p>Click on refit run or refit all to update the fitted table and the resized table.<p>

        <h4 id="initial_fit">Initial fit</h4>

		<p> Table <a href="fitted.html">fitted</a> is created by joining  readings( <a href="r.html">table r</a> ) to the <a href="routes.html">routes table</a> <p>

		
        <h4 id="correcting for season">Correcting for Season</h4>

		<p> Where the section is marked as a benchmark in <a href="network.html">network</a> and the run is marked as a benchmark in <a href="run_info.html">run_info</a>
		readings from fitted are inserted into the <a href="benchmarks.html">benchmarks table</a>.
		The benchmarks table is used to calculate <a href="correction_factors.html">seasonal correction factors</a>.
		These correction factors and season from <a href="run_info.html">run_info</a> are used to update fitted, calculating sfc from gn.
		<p>


        <h4 id="resizing">Resizing</h4>

		<p> Table <a href="resized.html">resized</a> is made by joining <a href="fitted.html">fitted</a> to 10m <a href="pieces.html">pieces</a> of requested sections.
			sfc is calculated as the mean sfc of all readings with section chainage within range. When there are no readings in range readings from 10m either side are used.
